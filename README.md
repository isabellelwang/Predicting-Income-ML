# Predicting-Income-ML

Name: Isabelle Wang

Dataset: Census Data set

This project is about using supervised learning techniques and KNN and Decision Tree Models to predict the income of different individuals in the census data set. The label is the income, which is a binary classification label consisting of "<=50K" and ">50K". I prepared the data using techniques like one-hot-encoding and winsorization. Then I trained the models and fine tuned the k-nearest-neighbor parameter as well as the leaf and depth hyperparameter for decision trees. After implementing the KNN and Decision Tree Models, I visualized the models using an Accuracy vs. Hyperparameters lineplot graph and also created a confusion matrix. This optimal model has an accuracy score of 77%.
